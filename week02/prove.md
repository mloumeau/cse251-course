# 02 Prove: Star Wars

## Overview

The website `swapi.dev` contains details of all of the Star Wars films.  You can access this information by making Internet GET requests.  You will be retrieving the details of the 6th Star Wars film.

## Instructions

1. Review the [directory structure document](../overview/directory_structure.md)
2. In your "week02/assignment" folder, download the [assignment.py](assignment/assignment.py) file from GitHub.
4. Your goal is to retrieve the information from the website as fast as you can.

**Coding Instructions**

- Each API call must only retrieve one piece of information
- You are not allowed to use any other modules/packages except for the ones used in this assignment.
- The only "fixed" or hard coded URL that you can use is TOP_API_URL.  Use this URL to retrieve other URLs that you can use to retrieve information form the website.
- You are limited to about 10,000 calls to the swapi website.  That sounds like a lot, but you can reach this limit. If you leave this assignment to the last day it's due, you might be locked out of the website and you will have to submit what you have at that point.  There are no extensions because you reached this server limit. Work ahead and spread working on the assignment over multiple days.
- You need to match the output outlined in the dcription of the assignment. Note that the names are sorted.
- You are required to use a threaded class (inherited from threading.Thread) for this assignment.  This object will make the API calls to the swapi server. You can define your class within this Python file (ie., no need to have a seperate file for the class)
- Do not add any global variables except for the ones included in this program.

## Sample Output (Log file)

The following in the **required** output of your assignment.  Notice that the names of characters, planets, etc... are sorted.
