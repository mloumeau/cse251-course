Purpose: assignment for week 10 - reader writer problem

Instructions:

- Review TODO comments
- writer: a process that will "write"/send numbers to the reader.  
  To keep things simple, send random values from 0 to 255 to the reader.
- reader: a process that receive numbers sent by the writer.
- You don't need any sleep() statements for either process.
- You are able to use lock(s) and semaphores(s).  When using locks, you can't
  use the arguments "block=False" or "timeout".
- You must use shared_memory block between the two processes.  
  You are only allowed to use BUFFER_SIZE number of positions
  in this shared_memory for tranfering data from the writer to
  the reader.  However, you can use other parts of the shared_memory
  for other purposes if you want by increasing the size of the shared_memory.
- Not allowed to use Queue(), Pipe(), List() or any other data structure.
- Not allowed to use Value() or Array() or any other shared data type from 
  the multiprocessing package.

Add any comments for me:

    # TODO - Start the processes and wait for them to finish

    print(f'{items_to_send} sent by the writer')

    # TODO - Display the number of numbers/items received by the reader.
